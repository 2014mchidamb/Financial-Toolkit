# Generating Comps

The compgenerator.py file can be used to generate comparables for a 
list of user-specified companies. The first ticker provided must be
the ticker of the company that the others are being compared to.

```
$ python compgenerator.py
Enter a space-separated list of companies: [your company tickers here]
```
